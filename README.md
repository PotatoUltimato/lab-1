- Comments: Resource wise, I used W3 schools and the github AI copilot to help fill in my knowledge gaps as I created the landing page. I had a lot of success getting my elements layed out how I wanted to in respect to each other (though it took a lot of troubleshooting). I also enjoyed diving into a website I use frequently and using the framework to create a landing page for something else I put a lot of time into. On the other hand, I wish I could've gone further into the CSS document and organized my index.html file better to make the buttons and text look better. I ran into a lot of time consuming issues involving class structure and orientation. This slowed my progress a lot, but I feel much more confident on how I should structure html files in the future to prepare myself for CSS styling.
